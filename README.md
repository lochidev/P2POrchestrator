# P2POrchestrator
A simple cross platform tcp p2p orchastrator for my game made with c++

This project is scrapped. I was not able to achieve my target because of increasing multi-threading complexity. I will try to design a better version from scratch when I'm freed next year because this thing is a mess 

But this might be a good indication of my knowledge on C++ STL and multi-threading. I learned alot working on this project

Amazing resource I used to learn multi-threading -> [Chili's multi-threading series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-1rZdMEzE8&list=PLqCJpWy5Fohe9b4gS5_HHyYcGNXVrtKUa "Chili's multi-threading series")
